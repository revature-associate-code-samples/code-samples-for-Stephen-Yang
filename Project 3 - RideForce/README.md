# RideForce

RideForce, previously RideShare, is a ride coordinating application for Revature Associates. 
All associates can create an account on the first day of training with a temporary access token generated by the app 
upon request of the trainer. A user who wants to offer rides can register a car with their account. 
Any associates who need a ride can coordinate with drivers who have registered cars based on proximity and preference.
